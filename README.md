# Compliant Klann-Linkage Robot
by Jerome Bastien and Lionel Birglen
Polytechnique Montreal, 2022

This repository contains the STL to build a walking machine using two robotic legs based on a compliant mechanism embodiement of Klann's linkage. We also included the Matlab source file we used to design this leg.

The work on this robot is described in:
